\noindent This table shows the effect of registering to the RPCI on the reported wage. \textit{Sample:} 10\%of the workers registered at the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) between January 2020 and August 2022. Regressions use the TWFE specification $y_{it} = \gamma_{i} + \theta_{t}+ \beta RPCI_{it} +\epsilon_{it}$, where $\gamma_{i}$ are dummies for each worker id, $\theta_{t}$ are dummies for each monthly period, and $RPCI_{it}$ are dummies where 1 means that the worker registered for the RPCI during that month or previous month. Regressions on columns (2)-(6) include fixed effects on linear trends, by interacting dummies on worker's baseline characteristics with a set of dummies for each quarterly period: (2) age group, (3) firm industry, (4) state, (5) wage decile, (6) all previous. Robust standard errors clustered by worker id in parenthesis. *** $p<0.01$, ** $p<0.05$, * $p<0.1$.

% \noindent Dado un estado, cada punto es el coeficiente resultante de correr la regresión $ent_{i} = T_{i} + \varepsilon$, donde $ent_{i}$ vale 1 si el trabajador laboraba en dicho estado en 2020, y $T_{i}$ vale 1 si el trabajador bajó el RPCI en algún momento. Es decir, dado un estado, cada punto en la figura representa la diferencia entre el porcentaje de trabajadores que bajaron el RPCI y laboran en dicho estado, y el porcentaje de trabajadores que no bajaron el RPCI y laboran en dicho estado. Por ejemplo, 25.2\% de los trabajadores que bajaron el RPCI son de CDMX, mientras que 16.4\% de los trabajadores que no bajaron el RPCI son de CDMX, por lo que la diferencia es de 8.8 pp.

The figures plot the percentage of workers that have the same wage after $t$ months. The workers that didn't register for the RPCI get the register date from the matched worker that did register for the RPCI, using nearest neighbor matching on the worker's baseline characteristics. \textit{Sample:} 1\% of the workers registered at the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) between January 2020 and August 2022. For the treatment group, compares the wage the worker had one month before registering for the RPCI with the wage after $t$ months of the register. For the control group, compares the wage the worker had one month before their matched treated worker registered for the RPCI, with the wage after $t$ months of the register. The y-axis measures the percentage of workers observed $t$ months with the same wage as in $t = -1$. Figure (c) present the difference between the bars in figures (b) and (a).

Subfigure (b) conditions the treatment group to late adopters, meaning the workers who registered for the RPCI during the next nine months (November 2021 to August 2022).
