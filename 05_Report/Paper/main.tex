\section{Introduction}


\section{Context} \label{context}
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS) is the Mexican social security agency. 

Workers in Mexico with formal jobs are registered by their employer to the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), the
Mexican social security agency. IMSS combines giving access to medical services as well as administering resources for the retirement of affiliated workers. IMSS benefits en globe several areas, including occupational risk insurance, maternity insurance, disability scheme, pensions, 

Employers report to IMSS the worker's job status, such as wage earned, days worked, etc. Taxes and employer's social security contributions are proportional to the reported wage.  Employers may under report the actual wage earned by the worker \citep{kumler2020enlisting}. Under reporting wages can be perjudicial to the worker, since social security, retirement and pension benefits depend on the reported wage. Workers tend to discover under reporting until they are about to retire, when they ask for their report on quoted weeks (quoted weeks are the period of time quoted by the worker with the IMSS). The report contains the information for each job the worker has been registered for at IMSS, including wages, employers firm name, and tenure. Since they ask for the report when they are about to retire, there isn't much they can do if they find under reporting. With this in mind, IMSS created the RPCI, a personalized report on the worker's current job. The objective is to make access to information on the worker's register easier.

\subsection{Effect on Wage Volatility}

\textbf{Q: Does registering for the RPCI lowers (yearly) wage volatility?}
\\
\textbf{A: No, it increases the yearly wage SD (around 11\% of the baseline mean), and increases the number of wage changes (1.6\% of the baseline mean). The increase on wage changes come from more wage raises, and has no effect on the number of wage cuts.}

Specification:

$$y_{it} = \alpha + \gamma_{i} + \theta_{t} + \beta RPCI\ Vig_{it} + \epsilon_{it}$$

where:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $y_{it}$ is a yearly outcome, such as the wage standard deviation, the number of wage changes, raises or cuts during year $t$.
    \item $\gamma_{i}$ are dummies for each worker id.
    \item $\theta_{t}$ are dummies for each yearly period.
    \item $RPCI\ Vig_{it}$ is a dummy where 1 means the worker $i$ registered to the RPCI during year $t$ or before.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Peer Effects} \label{peer}

\textbf{Q: Does having someone in my firm register to the RPCI make me more likely to register?}
\\
\textbf{A: Yes, it increases the baseline mean by 50\%.}

Specification:

$$RPCI_{it} = \alpha + \beta RPCI_{jt} + \epsilon_{it}$$

where:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $RPCI_{it}$ is a dummy where 1 means the worker $i$ registered to the RPCI during period $t$
    \item $RPCI_{jt}$ is a dummy where 1 means that at least one worker other than worker $i$ that registered to the RPCI at firm $j$ (the firm worker $i$ is a registered employee) during period $t$.

\clearpage

\textbf{Q: Does having more people in my firm register to the RPCI make me more likely to register?}
\\
\textbf{A: Yes, the increase of having someone at my firm register to the RPCI seems to come mainly from the percentage of people at my firm that registers, not from just if someone registers.}

Specification:

$$RPCI_{it} = \alpha + \beta RPCI_{jt} + \gamma Perc RPCI_{jt} + \epsilon_{it}$$

where:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $RPCI_{it}$ is a dummy where 1 means the worker $i$ registered to the RPCI during period $t$.

\section{Experimental Analysis} \label{experiment}

\subsection{Matching} \label{matching}
We perform matching using nearest neighbor matching with replacement and bias-adjustment, procedure developed by \cite{abadie2006large} as described by \cite{imbens2015matching}. We match using worker characteristics at baseline such as gender, age range, their mean wage and the wage standard deviation during 2020, temporary status, outsourcing status, and characteristics of the firm at their baseline job, such as if their job was in a government agency, firm size, firm industry and state. 

We calculate the distance between two values of the covariate vector $x$ and $x'$, using the Mahalonobis distance metric and the sample covariance matrix of covariates as weighting matrix: $\lVert x,x' \rVert = (x-x')'\hat{\Omega}^{-1}_{X}(x-x')$. Now for each worker $i = 1, \dots, N$ in the sample, let $\ell(i)$ be the index for the closest match, defined as:

$$\ell(i) = \arg \min_{j:W_j \neq W_i} = \rVert X_i - X_j \lVert$$ 

where we take the first match in case of ties (we set a seed and randomize the order of the observations before matching to get a stable match). Given $\ell(i)$ define:

$$\hat{Y}_i(0) = 
\begin{cases}
Y_{i}^{obs} &\quad \text{if } W_i = 0\\ 
Y_{\ell(i)} &\quad \text{if } W_i = 1
\end{cases}
\quad \quad
\hat{Y}_i(1) = 
\begin{cases}
Y_{\ell(i)} &\quad \text{if } W_i = 0\\ 
Y_{i}^{obs} &\quad \text{if } W_i = 1
\end{cases}$$

Define the matched values for the covariates:

$$\hat{X}_i(0) = 
\begin{cases}
X_{i} &\quad \text{if } W_i = 0\\ 
X_{\ell(i)} &\quad \text{if } W_i = 1
\end{cases}
\quad \quad
\hat{X}_i(1) = 
\begin{cases}
X_{\ell(i)} &\quad \text{if } W_i = 0\\ 
X_{i} &\quad \text{if } W_i = 1
\end{cases}$$

This leads to a matched sample with $N$ pairs.
