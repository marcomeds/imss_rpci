\noindent \textit{Sample:} 10\% of the workers registered at the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) between January 2020 and September 2022. Each point in the graph corresponds to the estimated regression coefficient where the sample conditions the treatment group by the cohort of register for the RPCI. All regressions have the same control group, meaning all samples include the workers who never registered for the RPCI. Regressions use the TWFE specification $y_{it} = \gamma_{i} + \theta_{t}+ \beta RPCI_{it} +\epsilon_{it}$, where $\gamma_{i}$ are dummies for each worker id, $\theta_{t}$ are dummies for each monthly period, and $RPCI_{it}$ are dummies where 1 means that the worker registered for the RPCI during that month or previous month, and include dummies for each state and dummies for each wage decile of the wage distribution during 2020, both interacted with dummies for each quarterly period.

The graphs use the estimators proposed by Chaisemartin and D'Haultfoeuille to prevent posible negative weights in the Difference in Differences estimators. Each subfigure conditions the treatment group by the cohort of register for the RPCI. Subfigure (a) conditions the treatment group to early adopters, meaning the workers who registered for the RPCI during the first nine months after the RPCI launch (February 2021 to October 2021). Subfigure (b) conditions the treatment group to late adopters, meaning the workers who registered for the RPCI during the next nine months (November 2021 to August 2022). Both subfigures have the same control group, meaning the workers who never registered for the RPCI.
